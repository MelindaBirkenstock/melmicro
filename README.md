This is a drop-in pro micro replacement for any board that accepts a pro micro. The name is a misonmer as the "melmicro" is actually usb-c.
# MelMicro supports both qfn and qfp mcus, i'm not liable for anything.



THIS MUST BE RAN AS A 4 LAYER.


STEPS.
1. Download "melmicro-panel.zip", This is the gerber file for melmicro panels that is required as jlc will not assemble single boards.
2. Navigate to the "Bom and Placement Files" folder, download the BOM for either "panel-au.csv" or "panel-mu.csv". 
3. Download "panel-top-pos.csv", this is your placement file for the pcb manufacturer.
These are the files necessary for pcba.
